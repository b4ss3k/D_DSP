      DSP60SE.EXE is a self-extracting executable file.

      on your hard disk.  To unpack the install files, run
      DSP60SE.EXE.  The program will self install.

      The install program will prompt you for the destination drive
      and directory.  The default directory is:

      \Program Files\DSP2002S.



   B) INSTALLING FROM FLOPPY DISKS.

      If you have a DADiSP/SE on 3.5" High Density floppy disks, the
      five disks should have the following files placed on each of

      Disk 1 of your installation diskettes) from the Start button. 
      Select the RUN option and type:

                A:\SETUP

      The SETUP installation program will prompt you for the
      destination drive and directory.  The default directory is
      \Program Files\DSP2002S.

   DADiSP/SE LIMITATIONS
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   DADiSP/SE is a limited version of DADiSP/2002.  Any single series is
   limited to 32K points and Worksheets are restricted to a maximum of
   9 Windows.  Series in the commercial version of DADiSP/2002 are

   EXTERNAL WORKSHEET DOCUMENTS (DWK Files)
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   DADiSP/2002 now supports external Worksheet Documents or .DWK 
   files (DADiSP Worksheet File). DWK files are single file, standalone 
   worksheets that can be saved or opened by DADiSP. In addition, 
   DWK files can be emailed and viewed by anyone running DADiSP/2002 
   6.0 or higher and DWK files can be displayed directly from the Web
   by Internet Explorer if DADiSP/2002 6.0 is installed.


   ACTIVE DOCUMENT SERVER
   ______________________________________________________________________

   DADiSP/2002 functions as a full ActiveX Document Server.  DADiSP
   Worksheets can be embedded, manipulated, saved and printed by any
   ActiveX Container application such as MS Excel, MS Word or Internet
   Explorer.


   CONFIGURATION FILE
   ______________________________________________________________________
   
   DADiSP/2002 uses a configuration file named DADISP.CNF to set
   parameters such as video mode and default fonts.  DADISP.CNF contains 
   comments and describes the options that may be set.  To set up your 
   default configuration options, edit the file DADISP.CNF.
   
   Some configuration items can be overridden by DADiSP commands or by
   DOS environment variables.  In all cases, DADiSP commands have the
   highest precedence, followed by environment variables, followed by
   items in DADISP.CNF.
   
   Configuration parameters can be dynamically changed during a session via
   the pull-down menus in TOOLS, CONFIGURATION.  Any changes are saved to
   a DADiSP session file, DADISP6.SES, which is stored in your \WINDOWS 
   directory.
   
   For more information on configuring DADiSP/2002, see DADISP.CNF and the 
   Appendix B in the User Manual: Modifying the DADISP.CNF file.
