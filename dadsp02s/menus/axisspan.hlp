AXIS SPAN:
Axes can extend over the entire plotting area or a portion of the plotting 
area.  By default, scales appear staggered and extend for the entire plotting
area.  This menu allows you to specify a portion or the plotting area for the
scales.

Specify the axis range to be displayed on the scales, and what percentage of
the plotting area for the axis span.  The scales will appear flush with the 
plotting area of the window.
