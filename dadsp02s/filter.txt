        Introduction
        _______________________________________________________________

        DADiSP/Filters allows you to quickly design, analyze and
        process both FIR (Finite Impulse Response) and IIR (Infinite
        Impulse Response) digital filters from easy-to-use pop-up menus
        or simple one line functions.  The filter module is fully
        integrated with the DADiSP Worksheet to provide a complete
        digital filter design, analysis, display and processing
        environment.

        The FIR module creates lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop,
        multiband, Hilbert transformers and differentiators using the
        Parks-McClellan/Remez Exchange optimal design algorithm.  The
        Kaiser Window method is also provided.

        The IIR module supports Butterworth, Chebychev I, Chebychev II,
        Elliptic and Bessel designs for lowpass, highpass, bandpass and
        bandstop recursive filters.  The bilinear transform method is
        employed and the resulting IIR coefficients are automatically
        calculated in the traditional multistage cascade format.  Both
        time and frequency domain characteristics of any resulting
        filter can be displayed and manipulated.


        Installing DADiSP/Filters
        _______________________________________________________________

        DADiSP/Filters requires DADiSP/2002 or higher.  To install
        DADiSP/Filters, simply follow the instructions as indicated on
        your distribution CD or disk.  By default, DADiSP/Filters will
        be installed in the MODULES subdirectory of your DADiSP
        distribution.



        Using DADiSP/Filters
        _______________________________________________________________

        Once DADiSP/Filters has been properly installed, the easiest
        way to design a filter is through the pop-up menuing facility. 
        To use the filter menu:

                  1. Start DADiSP.

                  2. Select the Tools-Modules-Filter Design menu item.

                  3. Select the FIR or IIR Filter Design item.


        The Filters Module will also install a Filters button in the
        toolbar.  The filter design dialog boxes should be
        self-explanatory.  Most dialogs also include on-line help by
        clicking the HELP button or pressing F1.


        You can also load the filter macros by typing:

                     macread("filter.mac")

        Once the filter macros have been loaded, you can bypass the
        main menu and directly access the filter menu by typing
        pressing the Filters button or by typing:
