 The Hypersignal Block Diagram 4.1 Evaluation software which you have just
 installed is a powerful demonstration tool which will enable you to build
 applications by using visual design methodology.  However, this evaluation
 version is very limited when compared to our full production versions of
 Hypersignal Block Diagram, and Hypersignal RIDE.

 Please consult the Hypersignal Block Diagram Evaluation on-line help for 
 further information on using the Hypersignal Block Diagram Evaluation 
 software. 

NOTE:
-----
 This Evaluation version contains a small function library.  The actual
 product contains a very large function library.  If you would like to
 receive information on the production version of Hypersignal Block Diagram
 or Hypersignal RIDE products please contact us.
