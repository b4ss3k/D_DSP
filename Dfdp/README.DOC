DFDP now supports the extended graphics adapter.  Use the
INSTALL program to access your EGA.


                    DFDP on the IBM AT

This handout provides information that allows owners of IBM 
AT computers that do not have an 80287 numeric coprocessor 
to use versions 1.10 and 2.12 of DFDP. Those who have 
the 80287 should not experience any problems with floating 
point calculations, and DFDP has no floating point problems
when used on an IBM PC.

 
If you do not have a coprocessor, you need to explicitly tell 
DFDP that there is no coprocessor by issuing the following 
command in DOS before running the program:

	 SET NO87=8087 Suppressed 

This command forces the use of the floating point emulation 
software and is necessary because an AT with no coprocessor 
fools DFDP into thinking that there is a coprocessor 
present, and DFDP will return incorrect results.
